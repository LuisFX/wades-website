            <p class="customapparel-p"> This is something that is rather new to me. I started off with my girlfriend's denim jacket. 
                This was very interesting to me because, I'm so used to just canvas painting or spray-painting. So, learning to paint on 
                clothing was a challenge, but I ended up really liking it. Now a lot more people can see my art since you can wear it around. 
                I'm in the process of starting a line of wearable art. Until now, enjoy what I have done so far!

                <p class="customapparel-p"> MY girlfriend is a preschool teacher, and she wanted something that is school appropriate and fun and colorful.
                    I painted this and now everytime she goes out she gets complemented. I love it, keep an eye out for more to come!
