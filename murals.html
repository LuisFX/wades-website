                <p class="murals-p"> This is something that I really wish I could do more of! I want to be able to go and paint murals all over the world!
                    These murals are so challenging and fun! As an artist I always like to see how big I can paint something! When talking to clients about 
                    getting a custom painting I always tell them to go as big as they can and the reason is simply because I really love making big paintings!
                    I'm not a fan of small canvas paintings. Something about spending a week or two and just full sending a huge mural gets me stoked! If you
                    know anyone who might want to get a mural done please reach out! I would LOVE to do it!

                <p class="murals-p">I was working for this company Approved Providers Network and they were moving to a new office.
                    I asked if they would let me paint a big mural and they said yes! They wanted a call center vibe with phones
                    and money and sales happening. Everyone is happy and the making money! I drew some random characters and then had to 
                    tell the owners I have an idea but I cant put it on paper, I just need to go for it. They gave me the freedom to
                    just go bonkers. I was working full time and I couldnt go there to paint while the workers were working so I had 
                    only late nights and weekends to get it done. This ended up working out great becuase I would go and bring redbull 
                    and titos and get smashed and paint till like 3AM! <strong>Big Vibes!</strong> The painting ended up turing out super
                    sick and I think this one is so dope! Not only the size but the colors and the flow work out perfectly!

                        in his master bed room. He told me that he wanted a NY city 4th of July party vibe. I drew out an idea and 
                        he loved it. He was blown away and loves the mural.
