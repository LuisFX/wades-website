            <p class="characters-p">Back when I was a kid I would always
                look at graffiti characters on Google and be like damn.. 
                I want to one day be able to draw cool characters like 
                that! I would put my paper on the screen and trace out 
                the character then color it in. I would try to draw my 
                own. I was never able to get anywhere close to what 
                other people could draw. Now that im old and have found 
                my own style I see how people made those characters. 
                Now that I have learned how to make weird funky characters 
                I can tell you guys it's all about finding your own style and 
                drawing eyes and noses and ears. Then trying to put it all 
                together with a lot of color and just see what happens. If it works 
                and if it doesn't change it so that it will work.

                 the fights and I saw he had a bunch of spray paint in the barn/shed,
                 and I asked if he would let me paint a little somethin somethin. He said run it!
                 Next thing you know buddy's out here for like 30 min getting Bob Ross and this
                 is the outcome! It's still there to this day!

                    because we would go and skateboard together. I found out that he was an artist as well.
                    We agreed to do an art trade. This is the one I made for him. Check out his page to 
                    see the one he gave me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skebahdobopow/" target="_blank">@skebahdobopow</a>

                <p class="characters-p">I was watching old wild boys videos and saw the episode where they went to Africa. 
                    It for sure gave me the inspiration to paint The Man and The Woman.

                    <p class="characters-p">Great story behind this one! I went to my buddy's party and it was a combo party,
                        my buddy Joey and his friends and his sister and her friends. The house was packed, 
                        were talkin 50-60 people there! Buddy was already buzz on and grabbed about 5 white 
                        claws and went upstairs to where the chalk board is and started to get Bob Ross AF!
                        I lost track of time and this probably took me about 2 hours. People thought I left 
                        the party or just disappeared. Here I come down the stairs 2 hours later, at this time 
                        about 10 white claws deep and covered in chalk to finish the rest of the night trying 
                        to show everyone my drawing! lol! Cool thing is that it's still on that chalk board today!

                <p class="characters-p">This is a very interesting painting. There's a lot that went into this and its very special to me for a number of reasons.
                    First, I got invited to do a live painting for a music festival in Joshua Tree! I never really painted 
                    in front of anyone exact maybe my girlfriend or just a few of my buddies who stopped by the studio or what ever. 
                    Anyway, I'm trying to figure out what to paint, so I just grab a silver Sharpie and just started drawing the ugliest 
                    weirdest thing. I show up to Joshua tree and just go for it. I was so windy that the canvas hardly stayed on the easel.
                     I had sand blowing into the paint which ended up giving it a pretty cool texture. All and all, I love how it turned out
                     I went to raffle it off and the winner never pick it up or met up with me, so I still have it and get to enjoy it every day.
