                    <p class="paintings-p">Little backstory on this guy, I went over to my buddy's house to watch
                    the fights and I saw he had a bunch of spray paint in the barn/shed,
                    and I asked if he would let me paint a little somethin somethin. He said run it!
                    Next thing you know buddy's out here for like 30 min getting Bob Ross and this
                    is the outcome! It's still there to this day!

                 <p class="paintings-p">This is my favorite custom painting that I have done. One of my
                    good friends started a podcast (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/mindmeetings/" target="_blank">@mindmeetings</a>) and asked for a painting that would hang 
                    on the wall of his studio. I got back the guidelines and the idea of what he wanted, a month of painting
                    and a lot of color and here's the magic! When I was doing the painting I was worried it would
                    be a little too busy, so I put some white and some outlines, and it came out better than I could imagine!
                    Thank you again (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/zacharyxbrown/" target="_blank">@Zacharyxbrown</a>) for the opportunity!

                <p class="paintings-p">I started an surf/skate apparel company (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/exxtra.ranch/">@exxtra.ranch</a>) that takes my crazy art and turns it into 
                    awesome T-shirts! I had three BIG canvases just sitting in my art studio. I put them together and made this awesome painting. It took about 3 weeks and I love it! 
                    It's the main painting in my room right now!

                <p class="paintings-p">I moved into a house with my buddy, and we had to find a roommate to fill one of the rooms.
                    We found this dude Matt, and he ended up being super chill and one of the boys! He is really into street
                    art, so he liked my painting style. He had an open spot on his wall and I asked if I can paint something for him.
                    He let me and this is the final product, ended up coming out super sick! Keep an eye out for some future tee's 
                    with some of these characters on them!

                <p class="paintings-p"> Frank reached out to me when he was redoing his Palm Springs home. He wanted a painting that will
                    be right next to the kitchen and above his poker table. He wanted very specific design and wanted to make sure the colors 
                    were right and that it included all the bells and whistles to make sure this painting will fit correctly with the style of
                    his home. Frank wanted fun and happy vibes, Palm Springs related, poker, palm trees, and included his Porsche. I drove it over to
                    him after about 2 months, and he absolutely loved it! I'm so thankful to have had the opportunity  to create this piece!

                        but in my style and let me pretty much go bonkers with this one. I had a blast making this and low-key want it for my room lol. Its a MASSIVE
                        painting and it covers the whole wall above his bed. Little more simple than some of my others ones and I love it!
